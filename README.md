# Smart Meeting Room Backend (Stage 0)

Starting from scratch. Building service-by-service with very small commits.

## Stage 0 Goals
- Create minimal users service with register endpoint.
- Use raw SQL (psycopg2) and PostgreSQL.
- Add incremental commits for each new endpoint.

## Next Steps
1. Add `requirements.txt`.
2. Implement `users_service` with `/users/register`.
3. Commit and push.

More services (rooms, bookings, reviews) will be added later.
